# Codon Usage Analysis

## Description
This project provides a tool to count the occurrences of each codon in a DNA sequence and visualize the codon usage frequency.

## Setup
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Install necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib seaborn
    ```

## Usage
1. Place your DNA sequence in the `data/dna_sequence.txt` file.
2. Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    python scripts/codon_usage_analysis.py
    ```

## Files
- `data/dna_sequence.txt`: Contains the DNA sequence to be analyzed.
- `scripts/codon_usage_analysis.py`: The main script to perform codon usage analysis.
